GUI Random(ish) password generator.

Generates a 12 character (soon to n character as defined by the user) password.

This project is a work in progress and will most likely improve along with the quality of my Objective-C and Cocoa skills. (Incidentally, the improvement of said skills is exactly why I started this project).
