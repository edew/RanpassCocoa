GUI Random(ish) password generator.

Generates a random string (password is too king of a description now that I think about it) of user specified length.

I am creating this app in order to familiarize myself with Objective-C and Cocoa, as such it isn't intended to actually have an end product that other people will find useful.

This project is a work in progress and will most likely improve along with the quality of my Objective-C and Cocoa skills.

All code in this project is released under the GPL. (See COPYING)
